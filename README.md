## Manu | Java Enthusiast 🚀

👋 Hey there! I’m Manu, an enthusiastic programmer who also happens to be a coffee lover. When I'm not sipping on a cup of freshly brewed Java (both the language and the beverage), you'll find me diving into the world of code.

### About Me

- **Pronouns**: He/Him
- **Location**: Meerut 🏝️
- **Skills**: Core Java, Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs), and a dash of Advanced Java magic (think Java Swing, JDBC, JSP, and Servlets).

### What Fires Me Up 🔥

I thrive on solving puzzles and turning caffeine into code. Whether it's building robust applications, optimizing algorithms, or creating pixel-perfect UIs, I'm all in. My keyboard is my wand, and my IDE is my canvas.

### Projects I'm Excited About

1. **Library-Mgmnt-System**: A Java project using MySQL, Window Builder, and JDBC was used to create a desktop application that interacts with a MySQL database.
2. **Simple-Bricks-Breaker-Game-in-Java-using-Java-Swing**: The objective of Bricks Breaker is straightforward: use a paddle to bounce a ball towards a formation of bricks to break them and score points.
3. **Weather-App-Jakarta-EE**:WeatherApp is a Java-based web application that provides real-time weather forecasts and meteorological insights.
